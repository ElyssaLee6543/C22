# C22
The expected output in the instructions for the project is different from the instructions, because the instructions only tell me to create the constructor for the playerArcher, which I did. The instructions never told me to add it. I was a bit confused, so followed the instructions on the doc. If there is anything I missed, please tell me in our next class!
